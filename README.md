Project Description

Sentiment analysis is a common natural language processing (NLP) task used to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we utilize a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to analyze IMDb movie reviews and classify them as positive or negative.
Dataset

The IMDb dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews, with an equal number of positive and negative reviews. This dataset is pre-labeled and is commonly used for sentiment analysis tasks. For more details on the dataset, you can visit the IMDb dataset page.
Model Architecture

The RNN model used in this project includes the following components:

    Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vectors of fixed size.
    LSTM Layers: Long Short-Term Memory layers that help capture the dependencies in the text.
    Dense Layer: A fully connected layer with a sigmoid activation function to output the final sentiment classification.

Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed. Follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis-RNN.git
    cd IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis-RNN

Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required packages:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

To train the model and evaluate its performance, run the following command:
    python main.py

This script will preprocess the data, build the RNN model, train it on the IMDb dataset, and evaluate its performance on the test set.
Results

The model achieved an accuracy of approximately X% on the test set. The following graph shows the training and validation accuracy over epochs:
